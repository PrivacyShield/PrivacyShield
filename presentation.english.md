# Privacy Shield

## Privacy Shield: Protect your freedom online

The **Privacy Shield** project was born as a response to the growing threats to online freedom and privacy, exemplified by initiatives such as **AGCOM's Piracy Shield** in Italy. AGCOM, the Italian communications authority, has the power to block access to any website deemed to be in violation of copyright laws, even without a court order. This power, initially used to block football match streaming sites, could easily be extended to other websites, limiting freedom of information and expression online. Furthermore, AGCOM can intercept users' internet traffic and potentially fine them even for simply visiting a "suspicious" website, introducing a form of mass surveillance.

Privacy Shield aims to counter these trends by developing and implementing protocols that allow users to communicate securely and anonymously, protecting their privacy and online freedom.

**TSNL: A new network layer for privacy**

At the heart of Privacy Shield is TSNL (Time-based Spatial Network Layer), a protocol that creates a network "sub-layer" where users' identities are protected while allowing them to exchange data with high bandwidth. Imagine a labyrinth where your data is sent through multiple and complex paths, making it difficult to track its origin and destination. TSNL offers several advantages over protocols like Tor and Freenet, including higher connection speed and greater accessibility for the average user.

The protocol specifications will be published in the homonymous repository in this GitHub organization.

We intend to develop its implementation in NodeJS and Go.

**P2V: Free and decentralized streaming**

Privacy Shield also includes P2V, an innovative protocol that combines the characteristics of P2P and TV streaming, allowing the dissemination of live content in real-time in a decentralized and censorship-resistant manner. P2V can be used to create low-cost legal streaming channels for live events such as conferences, educational broadcasts, and more. Its decentralized nature and redundancy make it difficult to block streaming even if some users are blocked, guaranteeing freedom of access to information.

Its development is secondary to the TSNL protocol and would also act as a deterrent to the tracking of pirated live streams on classic protocols by the authorities, and at the same time could also act as a deterrent to paid pirated live streams in the face of more easily accessible free alternatives. Therefore, the implementation of the P2V protocol would only be done if strictly necessary, aimed at detaching pirate live traffic from classic web protocols in support of its neutrality.

**Objective: Defend net neutrality and digital rights**

The goal of Privacy Shield is not to promote piracy, but to protect net neutrality and the fundamental rights of citizens, such as freedom of expression and the right to privacy. Privacy Shield aims to render online control and surveillance measures ineffective, pushing governments to respect the freedom and privacy of citizens.

**Join the fight for online freedom**

Privacy Shield is a non-profit project committed to developing tools to protect online freedom. Contribute to the project, spread information about online surveillance, and support organizations that defend digital rights. Together we can build a freer and more open digital future.

**Note:** Privacy Shield is designed to work in networks of nations with democratic principles. We cannot guarantee its operation in networks with a high level of control and censorship, such as the Chinese "Great Firewall". Furthermore, it is important to remember that no technology can guarantee absolute anonymity, especially in the case of targeted investigations. The fight for online freedom requires constant commitment at the political and social level.

## Legal issues

The Privacy Shield project has no intention, direct or indirect, of either profiting from or actively contributing to the dissemination of pirated content, but solely to react to possible dangers to freedom and democracy with the development of counterbalancing protocols and software, without ever providing content, in full compliance with the law. In the event that a developer or collaborator [suffers intimidation](https://www.open.online/2024/10/11/luca-arnau-giornalista-perquisizione-diffamazione-giorgia-meloni-corona/) explicit or implicit, such as complaints or searches, it is important that they note it in the discussions of this repository.

Reactions to the threat to individual freedom do not and must not depend on political ideologies but on the Enlightenment principles that formed the foundations of democracy.
